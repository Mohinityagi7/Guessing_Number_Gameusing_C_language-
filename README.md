PROBLEM 1:- This is going to be fun!
            We will write a program that generatesa random number and asks the players to guess it if the players. 
            Guess is higher than the actual number the program display.
            "Lower number please" Similarly  if the user gusse is too low the program prints, 
            "Higher number please.
            
            Whene the user guess the correct number the program display  the number, of 
            guess the player user to arrive at the number.
